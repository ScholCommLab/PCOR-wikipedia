Retrieving Wikipedia mentions of patient-centered outcomes research

## Reproduce results

@todo: create instructions

## Metrics

- Crossref Event Data (accessible through Paperbuzz API)
- Altmetric.com (accessible through their API)

Both provide Wikipedia mentions, but results will differ. Let's look at this paper http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6323/389 which has made it into Altmetric's Top 100 for 2017.

- Altmetric.com details: https://www.altmetric.com/details/15836717
- Summary of Crossref Event Data: http://paperbuzz.org/details/10.1126/science.aah6524

It's important that both metrics describe two different types of observations.
